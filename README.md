### Welcome to Leitner page.
Leitner system is a method to help memorizing efficiently. Every time I looked on the web for a package to do the job, I could not find the right version. At the end I concluded none of the authors have understood the Leitner system right. I made my Leitner system in Python to help learning Spanish language. But this Leitner System can be used for anything!

To start just create your own `courseraw.txt` and start putting your data in the text. See an example file below:

```
¡Hola!
Hello!
¡Adios!
Bye!
```

### Authors and Contributors
This code is developed by @amirtar to expedite learning Spanish! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
